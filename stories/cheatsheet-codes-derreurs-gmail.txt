	<h1>Conversations</h1>
	<div class="main-section--answer main-section content-container">
	<p>Gmail groups all replies with their original message, creating a single conversation or thread.  In other email systems, responses appear as separate messages in your inbox, forcing you to wade through all your mail to follow the conversation.  In Gmail, replies to emails (and replies to those replies) are displayed in one place, in order, making it easier to understand the context of a message -- or to follow the <strong>conversation</strong>.</p>
	<p>When you open one message in a conversation, all of your related messages will be stacked neatly on top of each other. We call this Conversation View. In Conversation View, each new message is stacked on top of the ones that arrived before it, so that the newest message is always the one you see first.</p>
	<p>To see all the messages in a conversation, just click  the "Expand all" button.  <img class="shadow" src="//www.google.com/help/hc/images/mail/mail_expand_all.png"/>
	</p>
	<p>A conversation will break off into a new thread if the subject line of the conversation is changed, or if the conversation reaches over 100 messages.</p>
	<p>If you'd like, you can change this setting so that replies aren't threaded into conversations, but appear as individual messages in your inbox. To do so, go to the <strong>General</strong> tab of your Gmail Settings, and select the radio button next to 'Conversation view off'. </p>

	<h1>Supported browsers</h1>
	<div class="main-section--answer main-section content-container"><p>You can access Gmail via a browser installed on a PC, Mac, or Linux computer. To access Gmail via a browser installed on a mobile device, make sure your mobile browser meets these <a href="//support.google.com/mail/bin/answer.py?answer=38689">minimum requirements</a>.</p>
	<h3>To get the latest Gmail features, use a supported browser</h3>
	<p>In general, Gmail supports the current and prior major release of Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer and Safari on a rolling basis. If you use a browser other than those listed below, you'll be automatically directed to the <a href="//mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=15046">basic HTML view</a> of Gmail.</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Google Chrome <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome" target="_blank">download</a></li>

	<h1>Your storage limit</h1>
	<div class="main-section--answer main-section content-container"><p>You have 15 GB of free storage to share between Google Drive, Gmail, and Google+ Photos. Your storage use is based on which of the following items you’ve stored in these three products:</p>
	<ul>
	<li><strong>Gmail</strong>: All the messages and attachments in your mail, including those in Spam and Trash.</li>
	<li><strong>Drive</strong>: Files you’ve stored in Drive, like PDFs, images, and videos. Anything you’ve made with Docs, Sheets, and Slides won’t count towards your storage limit.</li>
	<li><strong>Google+ Photos</strong>: Only photos over 2048 x 2048 pixels and videos longer than 15 minutes count towards your storage limit.</li>
	</ul>
	<div class="alert">If you exceed your quota limit, you'll receive warnings in each product and you'll need to correct the issue as soon as you can. Otherwise, you’ll be unable to upload additional items to your Drive or photos to Google+, and, after a period of time, incoming messages to your Gmail account will be returned to the sender and you won’t be able to send new messages.</div>
	<h4>Check your storage</h4>
	<p>You can see your storage usage and limit at the bottom of any Gmail page and at the bottom left corner of Drive on the web. You can also go to <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/storage/" target="_blank">www.google.com/settings/storage</a> to see how you’re using your storage across Google Drive, Gmail, and Google+ Photos.</p>
	<h3>What you can do if you hit your limit</h3>
	<p>If you are getting close to your limit, you can delete items that are taking up space or purchase additional storage.</p>
	<h4>Delete items</h4>
	<p>Since your storage is shared between Google Drive, Gmail, and Google+ Photos, you might want to see where you’re using the majority of your storage space and start deleting from there.</p>
	<div><a class="zippy">Google Drive</a>
	<div>
	<p>Files in the Google Docs, Sheets, or Slides format don’t use any of your storage space. Only stored files such as PDFs, images, and videos use storage space. Stored files can be up to 10 GB each.</p>
	<p>To clear space, look for larger files that you no longer need. An easy way to do this is to sort all your files in <strong>My Drive</strong> by file size:</p>
	<ol>
	<li>Open <a href="https://drive.google.com/#my-drive" target="_blank">Google Drive</a>.</li>
	<li>Click the <strong>Sort</strong> button in the upper right corner.</li>
	<li>Choose <strong>Quota used</strong>.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>You can also use search to find files. Learn more about how to <a href="http://support.google.com/drive/bin/answer.py?answer=2375114" target="_blank">search your Google Drive</a>.</p>
	<p>Once you have found files to delete, <a href="http://support.google.com/drive/bin/answer.py?answer=2375102" target="_blank">send the files to Trash and permanently delete them from there</a>.</p>
	</div>
	</div>
	<div><a class="zippy">Gmail</a>
	<div>
	<h4>Step 1: Find messages to delete</h4>
	<p>To find messages that you’re willing to part with, try using advanced search. In Gmail, click the down arrow in the search box and fill out the relevant fields.</p>
	<p><img alt="Gmail Search Box" class="shadow" height="30" src="//storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/SNP_E51370A18AEC47F3F78E58243BDBDB67C133_2935957_en_v2" title="Gmail Search Box" width="400"/></p>
	<p>For even more search power, check out Gmail’s <a href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/7190" target="_blank">advanced search operators</a>. Here are a few search operators to get you started:</p>
	<table class="nice-table">

	</tr>
	</tbody>
	</table>
	<h4>Step 2: Select messages and send to Trash</h4>
	<p>Open messages individually or select messages in bulk using the checkboxes. Send messages to Trash using the <strong>Delete</strong> button.</p>
	<p><img alt="Gmail Delete icon" class="shadow" height="44" src="//storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/SNP_DAD8A1B251BFD6C18B57885696E151A5036B_3053256_en_v2" title="Gmail Delete icon" width="550"/></p>
	<p>If you found a large set of messages that you want to send to trash all at once, follow these steps:</p>
	<ol>
	<li>Check the box in the Select button to select all messages, or use the down arrow for more options.<br/>
	<img class="shadow" data-right="Gmail Select button screenshot" height="44" src="//storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/SNP_82B7A37DDDDB8C7C341541B1286B3D189A90_3134665_en_v1" width="550"/></li>
	<li>Click <strong>Select all conversations that match this search</strong> directly above the message list.</li>
	<li>Use the <img alt="Trashcan icon" height="16" src="//storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/SNP_70D947C48BDEC50BB153AC78E5BA25B0AC23_3134674_en_v2" title="Trashcan icon" width="16"/> Delete button to send all selected messages to Trash.</li>
	</ol>
	<h4>Step 3: Permanently delete from trash</h4>
	<div class="alert">Messages deleted from Trash can’t be recovered.</div>
	<p>Messages in Trash will be permanently deleted after 30 days, but you can permanently delete them yourself to make space.</p>
	<p>First, open your Trash label:</p>
	<ol>
	<li>Hover over your label list on the left side of your Gmail (where “Sent Mail” and “Drafts” are listed).</li>
	<li>Click <strong>More</strong> <img height="4" src="//storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/SNP_3094589_en_v0" width="7"/> at the bottom of your label list (you may need to scroll down).</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Trash</strong>.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Next, carefully review your messages. If you see a message that you don’t want to delete, select the message and use the <strong>Move to</strong> button to move it to Inbox or one of your other labels.</p>
	<p><img alt="Gmail Move to icon" class="shadow" height="44" src="//storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/SNP_55F0A6845A64A77EBF917B7ED7BCB2B437AD_3053296_en_v1" title="Gmail Move to icon" width="550"/></p>
	<p>Finally, you can delete messages individually using the <strong>Delete forever</strong> button, or all messages at once using the <strong>Empty Trash now</strong> link directly above the message list.</p>
	</div>
	</div>
	<div><a class="zippy">Google+ Photos</a>
	<div>

	<h1>Using labels</h1>
	<div class="main-section--answer main-section content-container"><p>Labels help you organize your messages into categories -- work, family, to do, read later, jokes, recipes, any category you want. Labels do all the work that folders do, but with an added bonus: you can add more than one to a message.</p>
	<p>Only you can see your labels, so whether you mark a message with "Best friend" or "Read later," the sender will never know.</p>
	<h3>Create a label</h3>
	Here's how to create a label that you can add to any of your messages:
	<ol>
	<li>On the left side of the page, click <strong>More</strong> at the bottom of your labels list. (If you don't see "More," grab the gray dividing line with your cursor and drag it down to show more labels.)</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Create new label</strong>.</li>
	<li>Type the name of your new label and click <strong>Create</strong>.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>You can also create a new label for a message in your Inbox by selecting the box next to the message, clicking the <strong>Label</strong> button above your message list, and then clicking <strong>Create new</strong>.</p>
	<h3>Apply your label</h3>
	You can add a label to your messages in several ways:
	<ul>
	<li>When viewing your Inbox, select the checkbox next to those messages, click the <strong>Labels</strong> <img class="shadow" src="//www.google.com/help/hc/images/mail/mail_label.png"/> button, and click the label you want. (Or check the boxes next to several labels and click <strong>Apply</strong>.)</li>
	<li>When viewing a message, click the <strong>Labels</strong> button to add a label to the message. You can also click and drag a label from the left side, and drop it on the message.</li>
	<li>When writing a new message, click <img alt="More options drop-down arrow" height="20" src="//storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/SNP_F4894A60E119A595466E4A0E6AD095E4714E_2679881_en_v2" title="More options drop-down arrow" width="20"/> More options in the bottom right corner of the compose window, click <strong>Label</strong>, and then select one of your labels.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Organize your labels</h3>
	<a class="zippy">
	<p>How to edit or delete a label</p>
	</a>
	<div>Hover your cursor over the label on the left side of your Gmail page, and click the down-arrow that appears next to that label. A menu appears where you can change the label's color and edit its settings, or click <strong>Edit</strong> to change the label's name. In that menu, you can also click <strong>Remove label</strong> to delete the label from your list and remove it from all messages that were tagged with that label. You can also edit and delete labels in the <a href="//mail.google.com/mail/u/1/?shva=1#settings/labels">Labels tab</a> of your Gmail Settings.</div>
	<a class="zippy">
	<p>Create sub-labels:</p>
	</a>
	<div>You can add a sub-label beneath a label to create a hierarchy. For example, if you have a label for your vacations, and want to create another specifically for a trip to Hawaii, you can nest the "Hawaii" label inside your "Vacations" label. When creating a new label, you can make it a sub-label underneath another label that's already in your account by checking the box next to 'Nest label under' and selecting which label you'd like to nest it under. You can also create sub-labels by hovering your cursor over an existing label on the left side of your Gmail page, clicking the down-arrow that appears next to that label, and selecting 'Add sublabel.'</div>
	<a class="zippy">
	<p>How to change your label settings</p>
	</a>
	<div>You can control some of the settings for your labels on your <a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?shva=1#settings/labels">Labels tab</a>. Get there by clicking the gear icon <img class="shadow" src="//www.google.com/help/hc/images/mail/mail_gear.png"/>, select <strong>Settings</strong>, then <strong>Labels</strong>. Here are a few examples:
	  <p><strong>Choose which labels appear in your list on the left:</strong> In the "Show in label list" column, click the "show" or "hide" link next to each label to choose whether it will be shown in the left panel of your Gmail pages. You can also set labels to appear only when they contain unread messages (otherwise, they will be hidden).</p>
	<p><strong>Choose which labels appear on your messages:</strong> In the "Show in message list" column, you can choose whether you'll see each label displayed next to its messages' subject lines. Click <strong>hide</strong> if you don't want to see that label name when you look at the messages it contains.</p>
	<p><strong>Delete labels:</strong> If you see a label that you don't want anymore, click <strong>remove</strong> in the "Remove label" column. (You'll have to confirm that you'd like to remove the label by clicking <strong>Delete</strong>.)</p>
	<div class="lightbulb"><strong>Tip:</strong> To keep organized, some people like to have incoming messages be automatically labeled and removed from their inbox until they can look at it later at a more convenient time. If you want to do this, <a href="//mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=6579">create a filter</a>.</div>
	</div>
	<p><strong>Note</strong>: Gmail supports a maximum of 5,000 labels, including sub-labels and IMAP keywords. If you exceed this limit, you may find that your Gmail experience is slower, and you may get an error. We suggest removing the labels that you might not be using anymore (deleting labels won't delete messages).</p></div>

	<h1>Archive messages</h1>
	<div class="main-section--answer main-section content-container"><p>Archiving removes messages from your inbox, but keeps them in your account so that you can always find them later. Archiving is like moving messages into a filing cabinet for safekeeping, rather than putting them in the trash can.</p>

	<h4>Why archive?</h4>
	<ul>
	<li>Clean up your inbox by getting messages out of your way.</li>
	<li>Archived messages stay in your account in case you need to find a phone number in someone’s signature or you become famous and write a memoir.</li>
	<li>When you delete a message (instead of archiving), it will be automatically and permanently deleted after about 30 days.</li>

	<h4>Archive many or all messages at once</h4>
	<ol>
	<li class="ghelp-hidden">Open <a href="https://mail.google.com" target="_blank">Gmail</a>.</li>
	<li>Find a group of messages you want to archive, such as all messages that match your <a href="/mail/answer/6593" target="_blank">search criteria</a> or all messages in a label.</li>
	<li>Select messages using the checkbox in the toolbar above your messages. This will select all messages that are currently visible on the page.<br/>

	<ul>
	<li>Quotation marks: &lt;'username@gmail.com'&gt; or &lt;"username@gmail.com"&gt;</li>
	<li>Dots at the end of the address: &lt;username@gmail.com.&gt;</li>

	<div class="main-section--answer main-section content-container"><p>When you type an address in the <strong>T</strong><strong>o,</strong> <strong>Cc</strong>, or <strong>Bcc</strong> field of a message you're composing, Gmail will suggest addresses from your Contacts list. Hit <strong>Enter</strong> to choose the name at the top of the list, or scroll down to choose a different address. If Gmail doesn't suggest the address you want, just continue typing.</p>
	<p>Gmail will first suggest the addresses you send mail to most often. To view a complete list of your most frequently mailed contacts, click <strong>Gmail</strong> at the top-left corner of your Gmail page, then choose <strong>Contacts</strong>. Next, click <strong>Most Contacted</strong>.</p>

	<h1>'Message exceeded 50 hops, this may indicate a mail loop...'</h1>
	<div class="main-section--answer main-section content-container"><p>Gmail detects mail loops based on the path a message takes before it reaches its destination. This means that if a message passes through several machines (i.e. if there is an over-complicated mail-routing system in place), it might appear to be a mail loop even if it isn't. When Gmail detects a mail loop, we deliberately bounce the message to break the cycle.</p></div>

	<h1>Ads in Gmail</h1>
	<div class="main-section--answer main-section content-container"><h3>How Gmail Ads work</h3>
	<p>In Gmail, ads are related to your Google Account.</p>
	<p>With features like <a href="http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2010/08/email-overload-try-priority-inbox.html" target="_blank">Priority Inbox</a>, we work hard to help you sort through the unimportant messages that get in your way. We use a similar approach with ads. For example, if you’ve recently received a lot of messages about photography or cameras, a deal from a local camera store might be interesting. On the other hand, if you’ve reported these messages as spam, you probably don’t want to see that deal. This type of automated processing is how many email services provide features like spam filtering and spell checking.</p>
	<p>We are always looking for more ways to deliver you the most useful and relevant ads - for example, we may use your Google search queries on the Web, the sites you visit, Google Profile, +1’s and other Google Account information to show you more relevant ads in Gmail.</p>
	<p>Ad targeting in Gmail is fully automated, and no humans read your email or Google Account information in order to show you advertisements or related information.</p>
	<h3>Privacy, Transparency and Choice</h3>
	<p>Google does not rent, sell or share information that personally identifies you for marketing purposes without your express permission. No email content or other personally identifiable information is provided to advertisers.</p>
	<p>Only ads classified as Family-Safe are displayed in Gmail. We are careful about the types of content we serve ads against. For example, Google may block certain ads from running next to an email about catastrophic news. We will also not target ads based on sensitive information, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, health, or sensitive financial categories.</p>
	<p>You can opt-out of the use of additional information from the <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads/preferences" target="_blank">Ads Preferences</a> page. If you do opt-out, you may still see contextual ads based on the message you are reading as well as other relevant ads.</p>
	<p>If you don't want to see ads in Gmail, you can choose to use Gmail’s  basic HTML view, or POP or IMAP.</p>
	<p>Also, if you decide to switch to a new email provider, it's easy to set up <a href="//mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=10957">automatic forwarding</a> for all new messages that arrive in your Gmail account.</p>

	<h1>Messages asking for personal information</h1>
	<div class="main-section--answer main-section content-container"><p>Some spammers send fraudulent mass-messages designed to collect personal information, called 'spoofing' or 'password phishing.'</p>
	<p>Here are a few ways you might recognize these messages:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>They ask you to provide your username and password or other personal information (e.g. Social Security number, bank account number, PIN number, credit card number, mother's maiden name, or birthday). Even if they appear to be from a legitimate source, or contain an official-looking webpage, be careful. Spammers often ask for this information in an attempt to steal your Gmail address, your money, your credit, or your identity.</li>
	<li>You might see a warning from Gmail when you open one of these messages. These phishing alerts operate automatically, much like spam filtering. Gmail's spam filters automatically divert messages that are suspected of being unwanted messages into 'Spam'. Similarly, Gmail's phishing alerts automatically display warnings with messages we suspect are phishing attacks so you know to exercise caution before providing any personal information.</li>
	</ul>
	<p> </p>
	<p>You should always be wary of any message that asks for your personal information, or messages that refer you to a webpage asking for personal information. One thing to be sure of: Google or Gmail will never ask you to provide this information in an email; if the message asking for it claims to be from us, don't believe it.</p>
	<p>Here's what you can do to protect yourself and stop fraudsters:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Check the email address of the sender of the message by hovering your mouse cursor over the sender name and verifying that it matches the sender name.</li>
	<li>Check whether the email was authenticated by the sending domain. Open the message and click on the 'show details' icon below the sender's name <img src="//www.google.com/help/hc/images/mail/mail_show_details_web.png"/>. Make sure the domain you see next to the 'mailed-by' or 'signed-by' lines matches the sender's email address. For more information on email authentication, please visit our <a href="http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=180707">Email Authentication article</a>.<br/>
	<img src="//www.google.com/help/hc/images/mail_8253_signed-and-mailed.gif"/></li>
	<li>Make sure the URL domain on the given page is correct, and click on any images and links to verify that you are directed to proper pages within the site. For example, the Gmail URL is <a href="http://mail.google.com/">http://mail.google.com/</a> or, for even more security, <a href="https://mail.google.com/">https://mail.google.com/</a>. Although some links may appear to contain 'gmail.com,' you may be redirected to another site after entering such addresses into your browser.</li>
	<li>Always look for the closed lock icon in the status bar at the bottom of your browser window whenever you enter any private information, including your password.</li>
	<li>Check the message headers. The 'From:' field is easily manipulated to show a false sender name. Learn how to <a href="http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=22454">view headers</a>.</li>
	<li>If you're still uncertain, contact the organization from which the message appears to be sent. Don't use the reply address in the message, since it can be forged. Instead, visit the official website of the company in question, and find a different contact address.</li>
	<li>If you enter your Google account or personal information as the result of a spoof or phishing message, take action quickly. Send a copy of the message header and the entire text of the message to the Federal Trade Commission at <a href="mailto:spam@uce.gov">spam@uce.gov</a>. If you entered credit card or bank account numbers, contact your financial institution. If you think you may be the victim of identity theft, contact your local police.</li>
	<li>Gmail doesn't send unsolicited mass messages asking for passwords or personal information. If you think your Gmail address has been compromised or taken over, please click <a href="answer.py?answer=50270">here</a> so we can help resolve the issue as quickly as possible.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>* If our system flags a message as phishing, but you've validated the source from which the message originated, click the down arrow next to <strong>Reply</strong> at the top-right of the message pane, and select <strong>Report Not Phishing</strong> to let us know the message is legitimate. And if you receive a message that our phishing detection system doesn't pick up on, click <strong>Report Phishing</strong> to send a copy of the message to the Gmail Team.

	<h1>My messages have gone missing</h1>
	<div class="main-section--answer main-section content-container"><div class="summaryBox">
	<h3>The Quick Answer</h3>
	<p>When messages go missing in a Gmail account, it's typically due to one of the following:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>A configuration issue with IMAP or POP access</li>
	<li>Settings applied to incoming mail, such as a filter or forwarding</li>
	<li>Deliberate or accidental human action, or possibly a compromised account</li>
	</ul>
	</div>
	<p>To help you investigate what happened to your messages, we'll walk you through a step-by-step process to eliminate possible causes of your missing messages.</p>
	<a class="zippy">Step 1: Search all messages</a>
	<div>
	<p>Sign in to <a href="https://mail.google.com/mail">Gmail</a>, then click <a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/#advanced-search">here</a> to prepare a search.</p>
	<p>Fill in the search fields with the details you remember confidently. If you're not certain about any field, leave it blank (Gmail won't return your result if an exact word match isn't found or the word is misspelled).</p>
	<p>In the 'Search:' drop-down menu:</p>
	<ol>
	<li>Select <strong>Mail &amp; Spam &amp; Trash</strong>.</li>
	<li>Click the <strong>Search Mail </strong> button.</li>
	<li>Look for the message(s) in the search results displayed.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>If you didn't find your message(s), move on to Step 2.</p>
	</div>
	<a class="zippy">Step 2: Check 'All Mail' and 'Trash'</a>
	<div>
	<p>Click on <strong>All Mail</strong> on the left side of your Gmail page to see if the messages have been moved from your Inbox. If that doesn't work, try looking in <strong>Trash</strong>, which is also on the left side of your Gmail page. If you do not see <strong>All Mail</strong> or <strong>Trash</strong>, click the <strong>more</strong> link at the bottom of your labels list.</p>
	<p>If you didn't find your message(s), move on to Step 3.</p>
	</div>
	<a class="zippy">Step 3: Check your forwarding and POP/IMAP settings</a>
	<div>
	<ul>
	<li><strong>Forwarding:</strong> In the <a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/#settings/fwdandpop">'Forwarding and POP/IMAP'</a> tab of your Settings, check if forwarding is enabled.
				<p>If so, make sure you haven't configured your settings to 'delete Gmail's copy,' or Gmail will move all messages to Trash when they're forwarded to your other account. To keep all messages in your inbox, select 'keep Gmail's copy in the Inbox' from the drop-down menu.</p>
	</li>
	<li><strong>POP:</strong> If POP is enabled, make sure you haven't configured your settings to delete Gmail's copy, or Gmail will move all messages to Trash when they're accessed with POP. To keep all messages in your inbox, select <strong>Keep Gmail's copy in the Inbox</strong> from the 'POP Download:' drop-down menu.
				<p>If you are using '<a href="http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=47948">recent mode</a>' with POP access, configure your POP client to leave messages on the server.</p>
	</li>
	<li><strong>IMAP:</strong> If you access your mail using IMAP, make sure you're using our <a href="http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=78892">Recommended IMAP client settings</a>.</li>
	</ul>
	</div>
	<a class="zippy">Step 4: Check your filters</a>
	<div>
	<p>Check to see if you have any filters set up. Filters can automatically move incoming mail to other places in your account. Please check the <a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/#settings/filters">'Filters'</a> tab of your Settings to verify your settings, even if you don't think you've set any up. Make sure you don't have filters that are deleting your mail, or causing messages to skip your inbox.</p>
	<p>If you can't find your messages in 'All Mail', 'Spam', or 'Trash', or by performing a search, then they've been permanently removed from Gmail. Messages that users place in Trash are purged from the trash every 30 days. Or users can go into Trash and choose to purge immediately.</p>
	<p>Similarly, you may restore your contacts within 30 days using <a href="https://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=1069522">these instructions</a>.</p>
	</div>
	<a class="zippy">Step 5: Check your account access</a>
	<div>
	<p>If you're unable to find missing data, it's possible your account has been compromised. Some users have reported missing messages as a result of unauthorized access. If you suspect your account has been accessed, follow the article <a href="http://support.google.com/mail/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=50270">My account has been compromised</a>.</p>
	<p>In the past, users have reported that they are missing messages as a result of unauthorized access. If your account was compromised and you would like us to investigate whether recovery is possible, please first complete the process described in <a href="http://support.google.com/mail/bin/answer.py?answer=78353">Recovering deleted messages</a> to secure your account and then <a href="https://support.google.com/mail/bin/bin/request.py?&amp;ctx=bugflow_receive31&amp;contact_type=bugs">file a report indicating your messages have gone missing</a>.</p>

For example, if you’re adding your company’s logo, you may be able to find the logo on your company’s website and right-click the image to copy the URL. Make sure that you're <a href="/websearch/answer/29508" target="_blank">free to use the image</a>.</p>
	<p>However, if your image is not available on the web, you can upload it to a website, blog, or image hosting service. For example, you can upload images to <a href="http://www.blogger.com" target="_blank">Blogger</a> or <a href="http://sites.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Sites</a>.</p>
	<p>Once you’re ready with the URL, go back to the <a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/#settings/general" target="_blank">Settings</a> page and click <img alt="Insert image icon" height="28" src="//storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/SNP_2663375_en_v0" title="Insert image icon" width="27"/> Insert Image above the signature text box.</p>

	<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
	<a class="zippy zippy-characters" name="characters">Extra characters added</a>
	<div>
	<p>If you notice extra characters such as * or &gt; in your signature after you send messages, it's because some versions of Gmail don't support rich text. For example, text you bolded in your signature might be marked with asterisks, so <strong>example</strong> would show as *example*.</p>
	</div>
	<a class="zippy zippy-long" name="long">Signature is too long</a>
	<div>
	<p>For rich text signatures, the maximum number of characters you can use is 10,000 (including HTML markup).</p>
	</div>
	<a class="zippy zippy-plain_text" name="plain_text">No formatting options</a>
	<div>
	<p>If you see “Plain Text” above the signature box and don’t have any formatting options while creating your signature, here’s how to fix the problem:</p>
	<ol>
	<li>Click the <strong>Compose</strong> button.</li>
	<li>Click <img alt="More options drop-down arrow" height="20" src="//storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/SNP_F4894A60E119A595466E4A0E6AD095E4714E_2679881_en_v2" title="More options drop-down arrow" width="20"/> More options.</li>

	<h1>Sending to a group of people</h1>
	<div class="main-section--answer main-section content-container"><p>You can easily send a message to multiple people at once, from a few friends to a large group of people. Here are a few options.</p>
	<h3>Choose a few recipients</h3>
	<ol>
	<li>Click <strong>Compose</strong> to start writing your message.</li>
	<li>In the "<strong>To</strong>" text field, write each person's email address, separated by commas. As you type each address, you may see an <a href="http://support.google.com/mail/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=6597&amp;topic=1669035&amp;ctx=topic">auto-complete</a> suggestion that you can click to add that address.
	    <p><em><strong>Tip</strong></em>: Everyone in the "<strong>To</strong>" field will be able to see who else you send this message to. If you'd rather be more discreet, add people to the "<strong>Bcc</strong>" field so that they can't see who else received this message.</p>
	</li>
	<li>Write your message and click<strong> Send</strong>. That message will be sent to everyone you added.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>If you need to edit or select multiple contacts, hold down the <strong>Ctrl</strong> key or the <strong>Cmd</strong> key on your keyboard and select multiple contacts.</p>
	<p>When you’re composing or replying to a message, hover over a contact’s name to see the email address associated with it, and double-click a contact’s name to edit it. If you have multiple email addresses linked to a contact, you’ll see your contact’s email address as well as name (e.g. John Smith (johnsmith@gmail.com).</p>
	You can also select people from your <strong>Contacts</strong> page by checking the box next to each person then clicking <strong>Email</strong> in the group details pane.
	<h3>Create a group of recipients</h3>
	<p>If you often send messages to the same set of people, consider creating a contact group to make it easier to email that entire set of people. For example, when you're writing an email, you can choose your contact group "Soccer club" as your recipient rather than entering in each person's email address separately.</p>
	<a class="zippy">How to create a group</a>
	<div>Here's how to create a contact group:
	  <ol>
	<li>Right above the Compose button, click the <strong>Gmail</strong> drop-down menu, then choose <strong>Contacts</strong>.</li>
	<li>Check the box next to each person who you'd like to add to your group.</li>
	<li>Click the <strong>Groups</strong> button <img alt="" height="21" src="//www.google.com/help/hc/images/mail/mail_group_dropdown.png" width="24"/>, then <strong>Create new</strong>.</li>
	<li>Enter the name of the group.</li>
	<li>Click <strong>OK</strong>. </li>
	</ol>
	  If you want to add more people later to this group, just check the box next to those people, click the <strong>Groups</strong> button <img alt="" height="21" src="//www.google.com/help/hc/images/mail/mail_group_dropdown.png" width="24"/> , and select your group. If you have multiple addresses saved for a contact, you can choose which address should belong to the contact group by opening the contact and clicking the small arrow next to the group you'd like to modify.
	  <p>Note: These instructions work only with the standard version of Gmail. If the steps above don't match what you see on your Contacts page, we suggest that you upgrade to a <a href="http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=6557">fully supported browser</a> or click <strong>standard version</strong> in your account.</p>

	<a class="zippy">How to email your group</a>
	<div>
	<ol>
	<li>Click <strong>Compose</strong> to start writing your message.</li>
	<li>In the "<strong>To</strong>" text field, write the first few letters of your group's name. As you type, you'll see the group in the list of <a href="http://support.google.com/mail/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=6597&amp;topic=1669035&amp;ctx=topic">auto-complete</a> suggestions.

	<h1>I can't see images in a message</h1>
	<div class="main-section--answer main-section content-container">
	<p>
	When you open new messages, some images may not appear immediately. Gmail disables images to protect you from unknown senders, like spammers, who use images and links to verify that your email address is real.
	</p>
	<p>
	Here's how to view those images:
	</p><ol>
	<li> Sign in to Gmail. 
	</li><li> Open the message. 
	</li><li> Click <strong>Display images below</strong> in the green box above your message. Or, if you'd like to always view images from a particular sender, click <strong>Always display images from sender@domain.com</strong> instead.
	</li></ol>
	<p>If you choose to always display images from a particular sender, you can disable this functionality at any time by following these steps:</p>
	<ol>
	<li>Sign in to Gmail.</li>
	<li>Open the message.</li>
	<li>Click the <strong>show details</strong> icon <img src="//www.google.com/help/hc/images/mail/mail_show_details.png"/> below the sender's name.</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Don't display from now on</strong>.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>At the moment, you can't set Gmail to display all images from any sender; you must do this on a per-contact basis.</p>
	<p> <strong>Internet Explorer users</strong>: Your browser settings may prevent images that are being sent through HTTP from being shown within messages.
	</p><p>You may need to adjust Internet Explorer's mixed content settings to view images sent through HTTP by following the steps below. Please note to be cautious of enabling displays of HTTP content, as some sites may have risky or malicious content that the browser setting is trying to protect you from.</p>
	<ol>
	<li> Access Internet Explorer's <strong>Tools</strong> menu.</li>
	<li> Select 'Internet Options' and click the 'Security' tab.</li>
	<li> Select 'Custom level.'</li>
	<li> In the 'Display mixed content' section, select the 'Prompt' radio button so you can make the choice on a case by case basis.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Next time Internet Explorer pops up the warning about mixed content, you can choose whether or not you want the content that wasn't delivered via HTTP to be displayed. Browsers like Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome may default to not showing you a pop-up in these cases, but will put a warning icon in the browser window as a notification of the non-HTTPS content that the site may contain.</p>

	<h3>Details and alternatives</h3>
	<strong>Effect of clearing cache and cookies:</strong> Keep in mind that clearing your cache and cookies erases your settings for websites. Here are some examples:
	<ul>
	<li>If you opted to have sites remember your username and password, they will be cleared from your browser's memory when you clear cache and cookies, and you'll have to sign in again.</li>
	<li>Websites might load a little slower because all of the images and content pieces have to be loaded from scratch.</li>
	</ul>
	<p><strong>Recommended first step:</strong> If you're seeing problems in how webpages are displayed in your browser, we suggest first using your browser’s incognito or private browsing mode to see if the problem you're seeing is caused by something other than cache or cookies.</p>

	<h4>Automatically added contacts</h4>
	<p>Email addresses are automatically added to your Contacts list each time you use the Reply, Reply to all, or Forward functions to send mail to addresses that don't already exist in your Contacts list. Each time you mark a message as 'Not Spam,' your Contacts list is also automatically updated so that future messages from that sender are received in your inbox. Also, if you use Google+, adding a person to your circle will also add them to your Contacts list in Gmail. If these addresses don't appear immediately, try waiting a few minutes or signing out of your account and signing back in.</p>
	<p>Look for automatically added contacts in the <strong>Other Contacts</strong> group on the left side.</p>
	<p>If you don't want contacts to be automatically added, follow these steps:</p>
