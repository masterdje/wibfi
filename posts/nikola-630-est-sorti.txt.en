	Compatibility Warnings

	If you have your own locale files, you may want to check them. There were some
	changes lately.

	If you use any themes from the Themes Index, make sure to update them â€” and
	make sure to upgrade the whole inheritance tree. For example, the
	base-jinja theme has a new file (tagindex.tmpl).


* And be ready to check everything everywhere...


Then

* Update through *git* , *pip* or direct download
